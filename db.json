The delivery was delayed because of demand supply difference but it was worth the wait. The first thing I did it was put on the the glass shield and cover. I thought it would kill the looks but it still looks nice. The iOS is very easy to use. Simple to go to all the settings."

Overall I'd choose the iPhone any day over all other smartphone because it's super good and has value for the money that I spent on and the only down side being the cost of it."
